# Print Sessions & Cookies
Nothing special or fancy here, just a nice little script for printing session and cookie values using PHP functions print_r() and var_dump().

I use this when I want to check certain session or cookie values or both. Good to use it in development mode, be careful if you are in production mode you don't want users to have access to this file.

print_sc stands for print_sessions_cookies :)
